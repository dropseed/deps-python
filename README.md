A [dependencies.io](https://www.dependencies.io) component that provides both "collector" and "actor" functionality
for Python projects that use "requirements.txt" files or [Pipfiles](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile) for tracking
project dependencies.

## Usage

TODO plainly explain anything a user needs to know to use this (what settings
are available, specifics about how it is going to work, etc.).

### dependencies.yml

```yml
TODO
```

## Resources

- [dparse](https://github.com/pyupio/dparse) is used as a generic requirements parsing library
- [pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile) original github project


## Support

 issues](https://github.com/dependencies-io/python-pip/issues).
 If there is private information which needs to be shared then you can instead
